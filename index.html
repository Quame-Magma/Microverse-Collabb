                  Kwame Nkrumah and Patrice Lumumba, leaders who staunchly 
                  believed that Africans must own and control Africaâ€™s resources. 
                  Both were overthrown by CIA-instigated coups; Lumumba was even 
                  brutally murdered by local agents of Western imperialism
